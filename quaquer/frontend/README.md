# Creating a Quacker front-end

Objective is to create a Quacker app (it is a clone of a twitter app, except it's with ducks)

How will we do it ? 

- use the back-end already available in [../backend](../backend/) for the API
- create a front-end app in the current folder
    - use [https://vitejs.dev/](vite) to fast track the project bootstrap
    - use [https://react.dev/](React) ecosystem for the components design
    - use [https://ant.design](ant.design) as a ready to go "design system"
    - use [https://jestjs.io/](jest) for unit testing
    - use [https://www.cypress.io/](cypress) for end-to-end testing of the UI
- have fun and be creative
